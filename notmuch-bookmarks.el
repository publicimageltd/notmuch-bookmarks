;;; Commentary:

;; This package adds a global minor mode which allows you to bookmark
;; notmuch buffers via the standard Emacs bookmark functionality. A
;; `notmuch buffer' denotes either a notmuch tree view, a notmuch
;; search view or a notmuch show buffer (message view). With this
;; minor mode active, you can add these buffers to the standard
;; bookmark list and visit them, e.g. by using `bookmark-jump'.
;;
;; To activate the minor mode, add something like the following to
;; your init file:
;;
;; (use-package notmuch-bookmarks
;;   :after notmuch
;;   :config
;;   (notmuch-bookmarks-mode))
;;
;; This package is NOT part of the official notmuch Emacs suite.
;;

;;; Code:

(require 'notmuch)
(require 'subr-x)
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'seq)
(require 'uniquify)
(require 'bookmark)

;;; Custom Variables:

(defcustom notmuch-bookmarks-prefix "notmuch: "
  "Prefix to add to new notmuch bookmarks, or nil."
  :type 'string
  :group 'notmuch-bookmarks)

(defvar notmuch-bookmarks-bmenu-original-keymap nil
  "Storage for original keymap of `bookmarks-bmenu'.")

  "Define this key in the bookmarks menu to filter out notmuch bookmarks.
If this value is nil, do not implement any key."
  :type 'string
  :group 'notmuch-bookmarks)
