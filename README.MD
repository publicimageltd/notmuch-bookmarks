# notmuch-bookmarks
Bookmark handling for notmuch buffers

This package adds a global minor mode which allows you to bookmark
 notmuch buffers via the standard emacs bookmark functionality. A
`notmuch buffer` denotes either a notmuch tree view, a notmuch search
 view or a notmuch show buffer (message view). With this minor mode
 active, you can add these buffers to the standard bookmark list and
 visit them, e.g. by using `bookmark-jump`.

 To activate the minor mode, add something like the following to
 your init file:

```
(use-package notmuch-bookmarks
   :after notmuch
   :config
   (notmuch-bookmarks))
```

 This package is NOT part of the official notmuch emacs suite.
